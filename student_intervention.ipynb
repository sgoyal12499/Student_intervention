    "    - Good at seperating signal from noise\n",

    "    - Doesn't account for interactions between features\n",
    "    - There is a high bias when there is a small amount of data\n",
    "- **Applicability:** Our student data has a lot of features - 30 in total - which could influence the pass rate.  Naive Bayes could be a good candidate on this basis.  Assuming a typical school environment where high-end hardware is not available for generating the model, this will be a good candidate for lightweight learning.\n",

By optimizing the tree and/or pruning it, algorithms have been improved for speech-recognition applications.  A key advantage of Decision Trees for accented speech was the favourable performance for adaptive data techniques - that is, using data from other models and implementing them into a current model.  \n",

Moreover, we only have 395 data points, there is not a high risk of intense memory and CPU usage.  Even if the student base increases, it would likely stay in the same order of magnitude.

    "Space will be consumed faster than runtime for training.  KNN defers computation to when you try to use it for prediction, so it's training time is O(1).  Prediction runtime, however, will go up as we add data. KNN needs to find the K closest points to a new data point, which means examining every point in the dataset (barring some clever sectioning of the data).  If you add 3 more data points to the set, prediction will have to calculate 3 more distances.  This seems to be O(n).\n",

    "\n",
    "KNN has the advantage of being a fairly simple algorithm to intuit the behavior of.  It just finds the K most similar points to a new data point, and uses a vote betwen them to decide how to classify it.  This works well for low dimensionality space that is relatively well clustered.  One downside of the algorithm is that for clusters that have complex decision boundaries, the closest points might not be a good measure of where the new point should fit.  Another drawback is that the prediction function is computationally intensive for large data sets, so adding more data will help the accuracy, but hinder the runtime for each prediction.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "In the comparison process I evaluated 4 common classifier algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM) over the sample dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite this, the maximal time is still less than a millisecond and is unlikely to cause problems even for schools with modest-hardware.  Hence, it is reccomended to choose the Support Vector Machines as a model. It has the most consistent performance regardless of training set size, and consistently delivers high F<sub>1</sub> scores around 0.75-0.78.  On the other hand, Decision Tree delivers lower, less robust performance from 0.72-0.73 and GaussianNB delivers a score of around 0.71-0.75.  Clearly, Support Vector Machines have the most robust and strongest model going forward.\n",

    "Future training set sizes are unlikely to increase by an order of magnitude so the prediction and training times are unlikely to increase drastically.  Moreover, even with a large training and prediction time, it is likely that the model would be trained and used on occasion at the end of each academic year rather than persistently.  This is because student performance and new school strategies are likely to be evaluated thoroughly once per year.  Considering this, performance and time are unlikely to be mission-critical even if order of magnitudes higher (i.e. seconds).  This means it is fine to stick with Support Vector Machines despite any performance concerns.**"

    ">Any description of a technical topic to a non-technical audience is likely to be fraught with poor assumptions about the transparency of given jargon and the struggle to find the appropriate level of abstraction to gain the necessary intuition for a given solution.  With this in mind I'll try to write simply to minimize poor assumptions on my part about any particular piece of foundational knowledge: The model selected from the experiment so far is known as a Support Vector Machine Classifier.  The name does accurately represent some of the underlying mathematical concepts at play, but rather than dive too deeply into the derivation of the name instead let's focus on how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "> SVMs can be thought of as an attempt to plot all the data we have on a grid, and draw the line between the categories that is as close as possible to being evenly drawn between them (maximizing the margin).  Imagine taking each student and assigning them a shirt color (red if they failed, green if they passed) and having them all stand on a football field at points are calculated as a function of all of the things we know about them (so the same employment, habits, demographic would place a student at the same point on the field).  Now we start trying to set out traffic cones on the field to divide the students in red shirts from the students in green shirts, trying to keep the cones as far away from any individual student as possible.  Now if we took any new student, not knowing yet whether they would pass or fail, we could still find the right spot on the field for them by asking about their habits, demographic, and employment.  Then we just look at where the new student is standing, whether that point is on a red side of the divison, or the green side.  That's how we make our prediction.  It's a bit of a funny picture to imagine, but it's a decent thought experiment to help set out how SVMs work in a familiar setting.\n",

This is unsurprising, and is due to the fact that the previous model would have been overfitted towards the training data.  This time, the training parameters have been cross-validated in order to make the training and testing scores more consistent.  Hence, although the training score has apparently decreased, it is actually less over-fitted and more consistent with testing.\n",

    "The testing F<sub>1</sub> score has increased notably after optimization, now bringing the classification into the 80%s - a 0.41% gain.  This is a notable optimization, and certainly worth the minimal effort to tune the parameters.  However, it has not massively increased the accuracy which may be an indicator of the limitation of Support Vector Machines themselves - a different, more intensive model, might increase the accuracy further.\n",
